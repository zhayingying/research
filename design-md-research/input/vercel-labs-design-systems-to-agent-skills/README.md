# DS Skills Pipeline

A pipeline that transforms design systems into structured skill files any CLI-based coding agent can use.

## Why

Coding agents hallucinate token names, invent icons that don't exist, and get import paths wrong. These failures happen because agents generate design system knowledge from training data instead of reading it from source code.

This pipeline extracts verified facts from your design system's actual source code and generates structured references that prevent these failures. Every token is enumerated. Every icon is cataloged. Every import path is validated against the package's export map.

## How It Works

The pipeline has 6 stages (plus one optional stage). Each stage produces a persisted artifact on disk. Stages are session-isolated — any stage can start in a fresh agent session by reading state from disk.

| Stage | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Interview | Asks the user scoping questions about the design system | `01-decisions.md` |
| 2. Extract | Reads source code and extracts verified facts per component | `02-verified-facts/` (per-component files) |
| 2b. Usage Analysis | (Optional) Analyzes DS usage in a consuming codebase | `02b-usage-patterns/` |
| 3. PRD | Generates a closed spec for every file to create (zero open questions) | `03-closed-prd.md` |
| 4. Generate | Produces skill files in parallel batches of 8, one batch per session | `skills/{ds}/` |
| 5. Assets | Generates exhaustive asset catalogs (icons, logos, etc.) from source | `assets/{type}/{platform}/api.md` |
| 6. Verify | Runs a shell script to catch import errors, missing files, structural issues | Verification report |

## Quickstart

### 1. Get the pipeline

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ds-skills-pipeline.git
cd ds-skills-pipeline
```

Or copy just the `commands/` directory into your existing project.

### 2. Install the commands for your agent runtime

See [`commands/README.md`](commands/README.md) for setup instructions per runtime (Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Aider, or any generic agent).

### 3. Run Stage 1 (Interview)

Point the interview command at your design system's source code:

```
# Example with Claude Code
/ds:interview /path/to/your-design-system

# Example with Codex CLI
codex --prompt "$(cat commands/1-interview.md)" "Source: /path/to/your-design-system"
```

The agent will ask you scoping questions one at a time. Decisions are written to disk after each answer.

### 4. Follow the pipeline

Run each subsequent stage in order. The commands tell the agent exactly what to do:

```
Stage 2:  Extract verified facts from source code
Stage 2b: (Optional) Analyze usage patterns in a consuming codebase
Stage 3:  Generate the closed PRD
Stage 4:  Generate skill files (one batch per session)
Stage 5:  Generate asset catalogs (icons, logos, etc.)
Stage 6:  Run verify-skills.sh (no agent session needed)
```

**Optional: Stage 2b** — If you have a codebase that consumes the design system, run Stage 2b after Stage 2 to capture usage patterns (wrapper components, overridden defaults, workaround comments). These patterns enrich the generated skill files with real-world usage insights. Pass the consuming repo path as the argument.

Each stage reads its inputs from disk, so you can start a fresh agent session between stages.

### Automating Stage 4 with the loop script

Stage 4 generates components in batches of 8, with each batch requiring a fresh agent session to avoid context window accumulation. For design systems with many components, the manual cycle (clear session → re-run generate → wait → repeat) gets tedious.

The `generate-loop.sh` script automates this by spawning a fresh agent process per batch:

```bash
./scripts/generate-loop.sh --ds myds --max 25 --unattended
```

Each iteration: spawn fresh agent → agent dispatches subagents → files get written → **script handles bookkeeping** (scans generated dirs, updates progress file, commits) → loops.

The script owns progress updates and commits via `update_progress_from_disk()`, which scans `skills/{ds}/references/{ds}/v{N}/components/` for newly created directories and checks them off in the progress file. This makes the loop resilient to the agent exiting before its own post-batch steps — a common occurrence when the agent runs out of turns after dispatching subagents.

Options:
- `--ds <name>` — design system name (auto-detected from `context/` if omitted)
- `--max <N>` — safety limit on iterations (default: 20)
- `--max-turns <N>` — agent `--max-turns` per iteration (default: 50, Claude-specific)
- `--agent <cmd>` — agent CLI command (default: `claude -p`)
- `--unattended` — run without permission prompts (maps to agent-specific flags)
- `--dry-run` — shows what would run without executing; also runs `update_progress_from_disk()` to show what it would detect

## Porting Skills to a Target Codebase

After the pipeline generates and verifies a skill, use the port command to deploy it to a consuming codebase. The port command runs in the **target repo** and adapts the skill copy to match target conventions (frontmatter format, skill directory location, settings registration).

```
# Claude Code — run from the target repo
/ds:port /path/to/ds-skills-pipeline/skills/geistcn

# Generic agent
your-agent --system-prompt "$(cat /path/to/ds-skills-pipeline/commands/port.md)" "/path/to/skills/geistcn"
```

The port command discovers target conventions automatically, reports any import path differences between source and target, and never modifies the source skill files. See [`commands/port.md`](commands/port.md) for the full process.

## Output

The pipeline generates a structured skill file hierarchy:

```
skills/{ds}/
├── SKILL.md                              # Entry point + routing matrix
├── references/
│   └── {ds}/v1/
│       ├── index.md                      # Component catalog
│       ├── components.md                 # Categorized reference
│       ├── guides/                       # Tokens, imports, setup, etc.
│       └── components/{name}/{platform}/
│           ├── api.md                    # Props, types, anti-patterns
│           └── examples/                 # Numbered usage examples
│               ├── 01-basic-usage.md
│               └── 02-common-patterns.md
```

See [`example/`](example/) for a complete 3-component demo and [`docs/output-structure.md`](docs/output-structure.md) for the full specification.

## Agent Compatibility

The pipeline works with any agent that can read/write files, run shell commands, and follow multi-step instructions. Sub-agent spawning is recommended for Stages 2 and 4 but not required.

| Runtime | Status | Sub-agents | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Tested | Yes (Task tool) | Install as slash commands |
| Codex CLI | Expected | Yes | Pass command files as `--prompt` |
| OpenCode | Expected | Yes | Copy to `.opencode/commands/` |
| Aider | Expected | No | Pass as `/read` or system prompt; run Stages 2/4 serially |
| Generic | Expected | Varies | Any agent that accepts a system prompt |

See [`docs/adapting.md`](docs/adapting.md) for runtime-specific instructions and how to run without sub-agents.

## Requirements

Your agent runtime must support:
- **File read/write** — reading source code, writing output files
- **Shell command execution** — running git commits, verification scripts
- **User interaction** — answering interview questions (Stage 1)

Recommended:
- **Sub-agent spawning** — parallel extraction (Stage 2) and generation (Stage 4) run faster with sub-agents, but can run serially without them
